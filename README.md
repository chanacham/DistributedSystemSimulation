# DistributedSystemSimulation
# This file is was a semester project in my Operating Systems course. 
# The program takes in jobs from a user and sends them to a master program. 
# The master sends the job to one of two slaves to be completed. 
# Depending on the current workload of the program the job goes to a slave optimized to perform it or not. 
# Once the slave gets the job, it will sleep depending on the job type and return completed. 
# As all tasks are completed, the system will inform the user via print statements.
